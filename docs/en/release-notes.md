## [1.5.0](https://github.com/coneshare/coneshare/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0) (2026-06-25)

Coneshare V1.5 focuses on maximizing document processing performance, lowering infrastructure requirements for self-hosting, and improving dataroom navigation usability.

This release introduces lazy document preview generation and client-side PDF.js rendering, shifting heavy rendering tasks to the viewer's browser. This optimization drastically reduces server resource overhead, allowing production deployments to run smoothly on lightweight 2C2G (2 Cores, 2 GB RAM) machines.

It also streamlines dataroom operations by supporting direct drag-and-drop file/folder uploads into virtual datarooms, deep link routing, and an inline document viewer for seamless adjacent item navigation.

For corporate security and accessibility, V1.5 introduces scanner-tolerant magic link email verification to prevent background link scanners from expiring tokens, and adds branded verification pages with unified footers.

Together, these updates make Coneshare lighter, faster, and more accessible for self-hosted workspaces, diligence datarooms, and secure external document reviews.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/coneshare/coneshare/compare/v1.3.2...v1.4.0) (2026-06-02)

Coneshare V1.4 focuses on making external collaboration safer, more structured, and easier to keep in context.

This release introduces Share Link Q&A for both single-document links and dataroom links, so owners and external viewers can discuss shared materials directly inside the review experience instead of moving questions into email or chat.

It also adds custom intake fields for File Requests, allowing teams to collect structured metadata such as project names, case numbers, invoice details, or document types when external users upload files.

For safer external document collection, V1.4 adds malware scanning to public File Request uploads, blocking risky files before they become workspace documents and emitting automation events for security follow-up.

V1.4 also improves visibility and operations with share link view counts in document lists, Sentry integration support, friendlier automation messages, and a backend health check throttle fix.

Together, these updates make Coneshare more useful for investor dataroom reviews, customer security reviews, client document collection, and other secure file sharing workflows.
